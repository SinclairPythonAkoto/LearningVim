# LEARNING VIM

In this folder you will find files that I have created using Vim.

As I learn, I will be creating new files and modifying old ones.

I will also create a list of Vim commands in this README file as I go along.

### Inserting Data
To  make changes to an exsiting or new file you press `i` to activate the **Insert** mode.

### Exiting Vim
Don't be one of those who cannot exit Vim ! You can close Vim with the folling commands:
- Press `esc` then `:q`  - quit without saving (no changes)
- Press `esc` then `:q!` - quit without saving (after changes)
- Press `esc` then `:wq` - save changes and then quit
- Press `esc` then `:w`  - save chnages but keep file open

### Moving The Cursor 
The trackpad or mouse won't work in Vim! To move the cursor you  can use the navigation arrows, or do what real programmers do and use the keyboard to navigate through the content in your files.
- Move UP - `k``
- Move DOWN - `j`
- Move RIGHT - `l`
- Move LEFT - `h`
